This lab-grown meat is created fully outside of a living animal, and thus is not flesh of a pig, even though it's the same genetic material. By that \"flesh of an animal\" standard, this isn't even meat at all, which is why it's kosher.

This lab-grown meat is created fully outside of a living animal, and thus is not flesh of a pig, even though it's the same genetic material. By that \"flesh of an animal\" standard, this isn't even meat at all, which is why it's kosher.

Forgive me for the mobile formatting but: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaped_Compact_Disc\\n\"AÂ shaped Compact DiscÂ is a non-circularÂ compact disc. Examples includeÂ business card CDs, CDs in the shape of a star, a map of a country,Â interview materialÂ and more. These disks are usually made for marketing purposes and are properly read by most CD-ROM drives (and audio CD players, although custom-shaped CDs tend to contain less data). There are many companies that sell CDs with custom shapes.\\n\\nUnlikeÂ Mini CDs, which are smaller, but still circular versions of normal CDs, custom CDs can be any number of shapes, even more complicated shapes like gears with dozens of teeth, but are generally smooth and with rounded edges, such as ovals or rounded rectangles. A logo can be printed on a shaped CD, in the same way common audio CDs and CD-ROMs are labeled.\\n\\nShaped CDs are produced in one of two ways. A special mold can be made and used to \"stamp\" CDs ...\n",

I've cut (accidentally) myself many times, it's never scarred. It's nice that he is doing it for free, but I feel like it is a bit unhealthy to want to cover it up. I look at my scars and see who I used to be, how far I have come, and everything I learned. I have been approached at work by someone who had a child who self injured, and I think I gave him a comforting bit of perspective on what it's like to be in that place mentally. What if someone who is thinking of doing it sees your tattoo instead of your scars, and doesn't ask you about it, and feels just as alone and misunderstood as a lot of us did? It's mentally stagnating to pretend like something that is an integral part of you just never happened.\n",

That was a really interesting read but I don't think he fully understands economics. He should probably work on developing industry so people have alternatives to farming and money can be obtained from other parts of the world via exports\n",

Unfortunately, your post has been removed from /r/nottheonion because our rules do not allow:  \\n\\n* Content that doesn't have an oniony quality to it (rule #2).  Your submission would be better suited for another subreddit.  Just because you think the title is funny or ironic, that doesn't mean the article is right for /r/nottheonion.    \\n\\n\"Oniony\" means a story _legitimately seems more like satire than news_ at the time of posting.  Not just a funny title, and not something that's weird but not a rare sort of thing.  Many submissions here are more appropriate for /r/Offbeat, /r/WTFNews, /r/FloridaMan, /r/WeirdNews, /r/NewsOfTheWeird, /r/NewsOfTheStupid, /r/Funny_News, /r/WholesomeNews, /r/EverythingScience, /r/Morbidreality, a ragebait sub, or a political sub.  It may also be /r/NoShitSherlock or clickbait that belongs in /r/SavedYouAClick.  We don't mod those other subs so check their rules, but your post may belong in one of more of them.    \\n\\nFo...\n",
